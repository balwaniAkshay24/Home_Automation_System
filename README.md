Programs for executing any bluetooth home automation system using GSM.

This bluetooth home automation system tests for 3 standard alarm systems.
First one is a fire sensor, and as the name suggests based on the trigger temperature it sends an alarm signal to the host phone.
Second one is a motion sensor, which is anyone tries to enter the house where this system is set up while the user is out will send an trigger alarm to the host phone.
Third one is a smoke sensor which works in the same techincality as a fire sensor.
